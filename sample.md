1.**version control**  
  1.1 **introduction**
  Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.  
  1.2 **history of github**  
  The GitHub service was developed by Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett, Tom Preston-Werner and Scott Chacon using Ruby on Rails, and started in February 2008. The company, GitHub, Inc., has existed since 2007 and is located in San Francisco.  
2.**collaboration**    
Collaboration means 'to work with another person or group in order to achieve or do something'. That sounds disarmingly simple. But then when you strip back what business is all about, it fundamentally comes down to coordinating the efforts of the company's employees to provide goods and services.
